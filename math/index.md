## Mathematical Notation

Throughout this textbook, we use standard mathematical notation. Key formulas and theorems are highlighted for easy reference.

### Example: The Pythagorean Theorem

For a right triangle with legs of length $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse of length $c$:

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$

This fundamental relationship has applications across many areas of mathematics and physics.
