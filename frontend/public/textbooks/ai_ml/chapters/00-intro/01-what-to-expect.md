# What to Expect

Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence. I'm hoping to help you understand not just how AI works, but how to work with it effectively.  I won't write too much about my educational philosophy here (for that, I would recommend [Why School Sucks](/#/textbook/education_systems), my book about education systems).  However, I'll briefly mention that I believe:

* **Time is a scarse resource.**  If I teach you something, I'll try to clearly convey why I believe it's worth your time.  If you ever happen to disagree, I invite you in advance to skip or skim that content.
* **Enjoyment matters.**  To the best of my ability, I've tried to sequence each chapter such that they are approachable and interesting. 
* **Memory matters.**  Each chapter concludes with a self-assessment to help you measure whether you've understood the key ideas.
* **We learn by doing.**  The book is full of practical exercises marked with üõ†Ô∏è"Try this".   I would not recommend skipping these.
