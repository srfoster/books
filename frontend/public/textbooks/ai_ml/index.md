# Artificial Intelligence 

## Introduction

> Master AI before it masters you ~ChatGPT

This textbook is about artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and language models (large and small).  My hope is that readers will gain new practical skills and a deep theoretical understanding.

I began writing this because I could find no other resource that I considered ambitious enough.  Books written for beginners are simply too shallow, and the more advanced ones assume too much prior knowledge on the part of the reader.  I wanted a resource I could use in classes I teach, with students who are pursuing bachelor-level coursework in computer science, computer information systems, and organizational leadership.

The only prerequisite knowledge I'll assume on your part is that which is I call "strong basic computer skills."  For example, I'll assume that you've used a computer for many years, that you know how to install software, manage files and folders, and that you are confident in your abilities to use the internet to help you when you get stuck.  Ideally, you've used generative AI before, understand what it can currently do, and now want to dive deeper.  

Our focus will be on how AI works and how you can make it do new things.  I believe anyone, regardless of background, can learn enough to help shape the AI revolution that's already underway.  However (and I know it may sound cheesy) you need to believe in yourself.

Modern AI didn't come out of thin air.  Rather, it's the result of decades of hard work, key discoveries, and creative refinements across a great many disciplines.  There's a lot to learn, and although I don't assume much prerequisite technical knowledge, I do assume a prerequisite *mindset*, namely:

> A strong growth mindset about computer science and mathematics.

In other words, I don't expect you to know about Python, linear algebra, statistics, or neural networks when we start, but my hope is that you're excited to know about all of these and more by the end.
