# Artificial Intelligence 

> Learn AI before it learns you ~ChatGPT

## Introduction

I began writing this textbook because I could find no other such resource that I considered ambitious enough.  In my experience, the texts written for beginners do a shallow job, and the more advanced ones assume too much prior knowledge on the part of the reader.

With this book, we'll cover the basic principles and advanced techniques of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and language models.  I am currently using this book in my own classes, with students who are pursuing bachelor-level coursework in computer science, computer information systems, and organizational leadership.

The only prerequisite knowledge I'll assume on your part is that which is often categorized under "basic computer skills."  For example, I'll assume that you know how to install software, manage your files and folders, and that you know how to use the internet to help you when you get stuck.  I'll also assume that you've used generative AI before and that you now want to understand how it works at a level of depth that enables you to do things with AI that others cannot. 

With that said, I should mention that I would only recommend this book to readers with a growth mindset about programming and mathematics.  I won't expect you to know Python nor linear algebra, but you should be willing (ideally excited!) to learn.  Because we'll be covering these topics and more.
