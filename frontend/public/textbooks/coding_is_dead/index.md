# Coding Is Dead

There's a rumor going around that coding is dead and that AI killed it.  For better or worse, these rumors carry seeds of truth.  

In fact, however, the situation is actually worse.  If coding were truly dead, we could move on to our "Coding is dead; long Live AI!" moment.  But the reality is that coding isn't *quite* dead.  Not yet.  That might sound like a good thing, but for college students, it's not.

Coding being "almost dead" means is that millions of people who truly loved what coding used to be are in various stages of dealing with the situation: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.  This makes the internet an especially weird place for students taking their first steps into the world of computer science.  Furthermore, textbooks written prior to 2024 are outdated (including both of mine[^1]); and anything written more recently hasn't yet had a chance to stand the test of time.

This book is for anyone just beginning their computer science journey at this weird time in history.  Many of my students tell me that it's like stepping off the boat onto a new continent and while the tectonic plates are rumbling, while the landscape volcanically remakes itself, while the maps become outdated more quickly than they can be read.  Compass needles that yesterday pointed north, today just spin.

So I'm writing this textbook "with flux in mind."  Students attending school now need something to help guide them through the next five years of AI experimentation, adoption, and innovation.  With the theory and practice of software engineering rapidly changing, education will change too, and it can be scary to be in the vanguard, learning things that have never been taught in schools and learning in ways that have never been tested.   

The good news is that there's a lot to look forward to.  If you want to be part of the AI wave that remakes the world, you're in exactly the right place, studying exactly the right thing, at exactly the right time.  I believe coding will die; it's true.  But I hope that by the end of the book, you'll agree that coding's death will be a true hero's death, that coding will leave the world better than when it arrived, and that coding's child and heir (AI itself!) can be a worthy successor, provided we all learn to properly use it.
