e6!

* I made it to move 38 before taking the blindfold off. In the last game that went long enough to require peeking, it was around move 32 when I did so.
* I did a better job than the last time of managing my nerves!
* I decided mid-game to not worry about the "writing my move before playing it" habit. I keep forgetting anyway, and I'm not really seeing any value from doing so. In fact, it's just extra cognitive load at this point.
* I forgot my insight from a previous game, but I'd like to remember it in the future: To continually review the notation-so-far, rather than relying fully on my memory of where the pieces are. At minimum, I think this habit will increase my retention of the game after the fact. I suspect it will also reduce the number of pieces that "go missing."
* I felt that my selection of 22... Qf5 (what I saw as the safe, simple option) was directly motivated by my previous insight that "make wild complications right away" is not the only strategy. Here, I opted for what I felt was a simpler, more "grindy" strategy, which seems to have paid off.
* I'm going to resist the temptation to look with the engine and first try to analyze the game myself, blindfolded :)
* My exercises of analyzing all moves (and psuedo-moves / lines of force) from the starting position earlier today was really helpful. I had a moment or two today during the game where I felt I was able to very quickly "touch" all of the candidate moves. My goal is to be able to do so during any position. But inevitably, I find myself not having quite enough time to maintain a full inventory of the position's possibilities while blindfolded, but just as a "pump" at the gym gives one a glimpse into the future of one's weight-lifting journey, I feel like I am glimpsing what it will be like one day after enough dedicated blindfold practice.
