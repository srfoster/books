# Blind in the Colosseum

## 2.

Now a humorous early resignation by my opponent -- humorous because they weren't losing, but they believed they were.  

### RomanSPb1969 (1566) - stephenfoster (1719?)

**1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 g6 3. e4 d6 4. Bg5 Bg7 5. Bc4 O-O 6. Nf3 Nxe4 7. Nxe4 d5 (0-1)** 

White is not losing, but I do understand the feeling of being taken by surprise.  It's happened to me before, and I've prematurely resigned many times in my career.  A possible continuation:  **8. Bd3 dxe4 9. Bxe4 c5 10. c3 cxd4.**[^1]

There was also the earlier **7. Bxf7+** if white prefers to mix things up (which, in my experience, opponents often do).  I think the psychological motivation is basically: you surprise me; I surprise you.  People don't like the feeling of being "out surprised" by their opponent, myself included.  That said, I think this kind of reasoning is a bit dubious.  The position does get quite interesting: **7. Bxf7+ Rxf7 8. Nxe4** and I've often been tempted by playing **h6** at some point, but I think this is not necessary.  Black can consider eventual exchange sacs on f3, and the more immediate **8. ... d5 9. Ned2 c5.**

And now, after a humorous win, it was only fitting that I should find myself facing a humbling loss.  In short, I did not "see" that my pawn on e4 would be undefended after pushing **9. d3-d4**

### stephenfoster (1989?) - wangchess88 (2244?)

**1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d3 Nf6 4. g3 Bc5 5. Bg2 a6 6. O-O d6 7. c3 Ba7 8. Be3** I felt clever here -- like I had made a move my opponent had not properly considered.  After moving their bishop twice, they would (I think) prefer not to move it again to take on e3.  

**8. ... O-O 9. d4?**  My other candidate move was **9. Bxa7** which would have been great.  But alas,  **9. ... Nxe4 10. Nxe5?** And now, I tilt: trying to complexify the position.  In retrospect, I should have considered other "Oops, I made a mistake" strategies.  **10. ... dxe5 11. Bxe4 exd4 12. Bxc6 dxe3 13. Qxd8 Rxd8 14. Bg2 e2 15. Na3 exf1=Q+ 0-1**

What I wrote after the game was:

> Ugh. I did an ineffective "minor piece check" right before I made move **9. d4**. I think I even located his f6 Knight but didn't notice that it was attacking e4. Then after I made the blunder, before my opponent's move, I saw the hanging e-pawn and immediately started hoping that maybe there was a lucky tactic.  And I convinced myself that I had found one.  But that "lucky" tactic failed (after dxe5, the Queen can see d4, and I lose the d-pawn). So: a cascade of errors.

> Should have been more careful on move 9, yes.  But I also should have been less tilted after that. Move 12 was me chasing a fantasy of a line that seemed to kinda work (their pawn ends up on g2 and I somehow manage to absorb it). But if I'd looked more objectively at move 9 and just said, "Okay, this sucks, but what's the simplest way to cut our losses?" I think I might have found the more natural moves. And a -1 disadvantage isn't necessarily fatal.

Another thing I wrote, which I put to use in the very next game was the following:

> I think I was subconsciously under the impression that if you are in a losing position, you should always complicate things. But that's not always true. "Complicate things" is just one strategy out of many. Another is to wait (hoping to complicate later, under more favorable circumstances). Another is to entrench and try to induce an error when they attempt to break your fortress. Another is to try to grind them down in a "boring" endgame while looking for drawing chances.
