* Do less / Slow down.  The "need to do" the "need to change" is a kind of tilt.  A kind of suffering.  There is value in doing "nothing."  Like breathing out.  And I have personally probably practiced this less, due to my psychological need to "finish things I start." 
* Goal: devise a "bottom up" way to get to a Good State / Plato's Republic e.g.  One person/school at a time 
* "See and seek value" 
* Suffering as a designer: my world could be better, and I can make it so; but I haven't succeeded yet
* Control/Non-Control => Cognitive dissonance
  - Conjecture (probably for religions book): Sex, for example, causes a lot of dissonance related to pleasure and control
* Wisdom is recognition of good (see my GPT convo debugging the circularity)
