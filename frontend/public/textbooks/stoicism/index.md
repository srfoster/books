How much control do I really have, even over my Stoic practice?  Certainly some.  And how much control do I have over the Good Life I'm trying to live or the Best Self I wish to become?  Much less, I think.

Virtue is the only good, and is wisdom a circle?

* Gratitude.  Joy.

* Over what, if anything, do we have control always, already, and at all times?

* Mindfulness "skills": What are they?
  - Observation of breath?

* "Pulling your mind back together" - Hanh

* Seeking suffering

  - Boredom
  - Not thinking (finding internal stimulation)

* Suffering == "Not to be"

On cold plunges and the idea of voluntarily seeking discomfort.

I came across this video where this guy (author of Sapiens) gave a pretty compelling argument that the definition of "consciousness" is the "capacity to suffer" and that "suffering" is best defined as "wanting something not to be."  (No need to watch the whole thing, just the a few minutes starting here if you want:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r5lw3jPrUk&t=1030s)

My conclusion after watching was that if one wants to voluntarily experience discomfort (e.g. suffering) and to acclimate to it, then the trick is to seek out experiences in which there is a desire for something "not to be."  Very cold water, for example, immediately makes me wish all the pain would "not be" -- ideally, as quickly as possible.  Exercise makes me wish all my sweat and burning muscles would "not be," and meditation often makes me wish my boredom would "not be."   Generalizing: Any situation that irritates, annoys, evokes a negative emotional response, or triggers a desire to change things probably contains one or more things that the mind wishes would "not be."  Any such situation (assuming it doesn't result in injury) would, I think, be a good context for leveling up through voluntary suffering
