# Chapter 1: Algebra

Algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It is the foundation for all higher mathematics and provides the tools for solving equations and understanding mathematical relationships.

## What You'll Learn in This Chapter

In this chapter, we'll explore:

- **Linear Equations**: Solving equations of the form $ax + b = c$
- **Quadratic Functions**: Understanding parabolas and their properties
- **Polynomials**: Working with expressions involving multiple terms
- **Systems of Equations**: Solving multiple equations simultaneously

## Why Algebra Matters

Algebra is everywhere in our daily lives:
- **Finance**: Calculating interest, loans, and investments
- **Science**: Describing physical relationships and formulas
- **Technology**: Programming and algorithm design
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable parts

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Working with fractions and decimals
- Understanding of positive and negative numbers
- Basic graphing on a coordinate plane

## Chapter Structure

This chapter is organized into sections that build upon each other:

1. We start with **linear equations** to establish fundamental solving techniques
2. Move to **quadratic functions** to introduce more complex relationships
3. Explore **polynomials** to generalize these concepts
4. Apply these skills to real-world problems throughout
