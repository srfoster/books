# Roach Experiments

*A deep dive into Zerg roach-based strategies and their tactical applications*

## Overview

This chapter explores various roach-centric strategies, builds, and experimental tactics that showcase the versatility and power of the roach as a core Zerg unit. From early game aggression to late game transitional play, the roach serves as a backbone for many successful Zerg compositions.

## Key Concepts

### Roach Fundamentals
- **Unit Composition**: Pure roach vs roach-ravager combinations
- **Timing Windows**: When roaches are strongest relative to opponent tech
- **Upgrades Priority**: Ground carapace vs ground attack scaling
- **Micro Techniques**: Focus fire, retreat patterns, and positioning

### Strategic Applications
- **Early Game Pressure**: Roach timing attacks
- **Mid Game Control**: Map control and expansion denial
- **Late Game Transitions**: Into lurkers, vipers, or ultralisks
- **Defensive Play**: Holding against various all-ins

This replay showcases a roach-focused strategy on Torches LE, demonstrating key decision points and tactical execution in a macro game scenario. The game features excellent roach-to-ravager transitions and demonstrates advanced Zerg macro management.

**Timeline Analysis:**
- **3:40** - Roach Warren completed
- **5:30** - First roaches produced  
- **6:00** - Ravager Cocoons begin morphing
- **8:30** - Lair completed, tech advancement
- **9:00** - Lair completed, enabling advanced upgrades

**Key Learning Points:**
- Opening build order and timing windows
- Roach positioning and engagement tactics
- Resource allocation between units and upgrades
- Transition timing from roach to ravager composition
- Late game evolution chamber upgrades

#### Build Analysis

The replay demonstrates a solid roach-focused build that transitions effectively into ravagers:

**Early Game Foundation (0-4 minutes):**
```
14 Pool
16 Hatchery  
18 Gas
Pool: Queen + 4 Zerglings
Metabolic Boost research
```

**Roach Transition (4-8 minutes):**
- Roach Warren at natural expansion
- Gas timing optimized for early roach production
- Queen and larva management for continuous production

**Key Engagements:**
1. **Early Roach Push** (5:30-7:00): Initial pressure with 6-8 roaches
2. **Ravager Timing** (8:00-10:00): Morphed ravagers provide siege capability  
3. **Mid Game Control** (10-15 minutes): Map control and expansion denial
4. **Late Game Evolution** (15+ minutes): Upgrades and tech transitions

#### Critical Moments
- **Roach Warren Timing** (3:40): Perfect timing relative to opponent's tech
- **First Engagement** (5:30): Early roach pressure creates map control
- **Ravager Morph Decision** (6:00): Smart transition for siege potential
- **Lair Timing** (8:30): Tech advancement enables upgrades and advanced units
- **Evolution Chamber** (16:20): Late game upgrade focus for army efficiency

## Experimental Builds

### Build Order Framework
```
14 Pool
16 Hatchery
18 Gas
17 Overlord
@Pool: Queen, Zergling x4
@100 Gas: Metabolic Boost
@150 Minerals: Hatchery #3
```

### Variations
- **Aggressive**: Earlier roach warren, faster attack timing
- **Economic**: Delayed roaches, stronger economy foundation
- **Hybrid**: Roach-ravager combination for siege potential

## Analysis Framework

When reviewing roach games, focus on these key metrics:
- **Unit Efficiency**: Roach cost-effectiveness in engagements
- **Map Control**: Territory gained/lost with roach movements
- **Economic Impact**: How roach aggression affects opponent economy
- **Transition Timing**: When to pivot to different unit compositions

## Future Experiments

Areas for continued exploration:
- Roach drops and mobility tactics
- Ravager bile precision and timing
- Underground movement optimization
- Multi-pronged roach harassment
