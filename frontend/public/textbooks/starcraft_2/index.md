I don't know why it took so long. Almost a lifetime, really, to commit to actually memorizing (and therefore practicing, and rehearsing) builds.

This collection focuses on proven Bronze to Grandmaster builds from top players like Pig and ProbeSc2. Each build is designed to teach fundamental concepts while being simple enough to execute consistently.

## Build Categories

### Protoss Builds
- **PvZ - Skytoss**: Late-game focused build with Carriers and supporting units
- **PvT - Zealot/Archon**: Gateway-heavy composition with Charge Zealots
- **PvP - Blink**: Fast Stalker production with Blink micro

### Zerg Builds
- **ZvX - Ling/Bane**: Universal early aggression and map control build

### Terran Builds
- **TvX - 3rax**: Marine-focused build with Stimpack timing

## Learning Philosophy

Key principles for mastering these builds:

* **Sticking to a repertoire of builds** - Master a few rather than knowing many poorly
* **Mechanics** - Focus on execution over complexity
* **How to learn builds** - Practice against AI, then ladder
* **How to evolve them** - Adapt based on scouting and opponent responses
* **Replays and videos** - Review and analyze your games

Each build in this collection has been chosen for its:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to execute with room for improvement
- **Effectiveness**: Works from Bronze to high levels
- **Educational value**: Teaches important game concepts
- **Adaptability**: Can be modified based on scouting information
