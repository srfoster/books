* Define "Education System" (recursive...)
* Politics: School vouchers, e.g.  Homeschooling anarchists, etc.
* WL's thesis
* Teachers, even when most successful, have robbed students:
  - Truth/Messy vs Clarity/Simple
  - Digestion on students' behalf gives them pre-digested knowledge, and they become hooked on it
* Lies/Omissions:
  - Future is unknown.  Yet education is about a child's future. 
  - Education system was "designed"
    - In reality, it is the result of a political battle ground
* Unresolved philosophical tensions structurally encoded
  - Get a Job vs Become a Good Citizen
    - If it's to prepare children to participate democratically as adults, why are schools structured like dictatorships?
  - "Critical thinking" is something both sides agree on.  Hmm, why might that be? :)
* Segregation/Desegregation
* AI can bring standardization like never before.  Or the opposite.  And many spirals in between.
* Mindfulness never taught.  (Yet arguably the most beneficial...)
* Competition is poorly addressed (often repressed) or left to student interpretation
* Forgetting is largely forgotten (and repressed)
  - Memory matters!
  - Rote memorization has been vilified
* Education "science" is gross, poorly done, often wrong, yet HIGHLY influential...
  - Whole language learning vs phonics
  - Australia's pivot against constructivism
  - Rote memorization findings?
* Standardization efforts widely criticized, but for the wrong reasons
  - Tests presuppose (and define) which skills are important.  (Not reading books, e.g.)
* Learning => Effort => Discomfort/Suffering => Need to obtain consent => Informed consent => Learning.  Uh oh...
* Factory model 
* Tyranny of Subjects
  - All or nothing (I'm bad at math)
  - Less effective "sales pitches" (Math is important because...)
  - Teacher specialization (Math teachers who don't know history are idiots)
  - Born out of the "need" to scale
  - Cross cutting concerns (critical thinking, reading across the curriculum) get lost and aren't measurable 
  - Cross-disciplinary efforts seem to help (Math+Art, yay!  But the categories persist...).  They probably make things worse, or at best create an "Illusion of Change."
* Misaligned incentives
  - Teachers should be making themselves unnecessary.  But they can't, even when they think they can.  And students/parents resist when they try.
* Knowledge vs Skill never addressed
  - Mastery levels never incorporated
