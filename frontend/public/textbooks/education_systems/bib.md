Educational "folk beliefs" (widely believed, but evidence unclear):
* Learning styles 
* Multiple "intelligences" 
* Discovery learning
* Teaching to the test is bad
* Rote memorization is bad

Reformist views:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Math_wars
* Algebra problematic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Math_Myth
  - "He describes the "math wars" over educational policy as a conflict between two schools of thought: a "discipline" approach stemming from 19th century American academic William McGuffey and a "discovery" approach stemming initially from the work of educational reformer John Dewey."

Standardized Testing and Metrics ("Science" of Education):
* Teaching to the test:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_to_the_test
  - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0738059321000754

    * Teaching to the test: A very large red herring - https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED570879.pdf
* Campbell's Law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell%27s_law
  - "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor" 
* Goodhart's Law: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law
  - "Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes."
* Lucas Critique: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique
  - "Given that the structure of an econometric model consists of optimal decision rules of economic agents, and that optimal decision rules vary systematically with changes in the structure of series relevant to the decision maker, it follows that any change in policy will systematically alter the structure of econometric models."
* Surrogation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogation
  - "the tendency for managers to lose sight of the strategic construct(s) the measures are intended to represent, and subsequently act as though the measures are the constructs" 
* Washback: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washback_effect
  - "Washback effect refers to the impact of testing on curriculum design, teaching practices, and learning behaviors"

Faith and education
* https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED570879.pdf "Secret definitions. Secret locations. Secret tests. Such studies may stand forever because they are neither replicable nor falsifiable. More like religion than science; they require faith. And, inside U.S. education one finds many willing believers"
