Coding
  - CIS110 -> Make memory/rehearsal front and center
    * Recursion
    * Vlogging journey?  Old outcomes are alt path? (But let them choose?)
  - Min/Max concepts: Come up with a concrete list of them for CS (ideally ones that span disciplines)
    * Pre/post test
    * Metaphorical thinking
    * Greedy algorithms
    * Bottom up / Top down
    * Breadth first / Depth first
    * Pseudo-code (for humans / humanities)
    * Various "data structures of the mind" 
    * Technical debt (AI coding especially)

  
AI
  - "Cognition" multiplier
  - Incentive to misinform via complaint (competitive ecosystem => hiding and hoarding; complaint makes change)
  - Claude is really good. (SC2 case study...)
  - "AI skill" -> Read fast + Recognize good progress and correct direction + Course corrections
    - PB&J is still relevant.  Code did what you wrote.  AI tries to do what it "thinks" you think you want. 
  - Can "back prop" be considered "mathematics of self-correction"?
    - Watch more Welch labs...

Religion:
  - Design your own religion.  Pascal's wager as a guide for wager design, not as a singular wager in and of itself.

Stoicism:
  - Do less / Slow down.  The "need to do" the "need to change" is a kind of tilt.  A kind of suffering.  There is value in doing "nothing."  Like breathing out.  And I have personally probably practiced this less, due to my psychological need to "finish things I start." 
  - Goal: devise a "bottom up" way to get to a Good State / Plato's Republic e.g.  One person/school at a time 
  - "See and seek value" 
  - Suffering as a designer: my world could be better, and I can make it so; but I haven't succeeded yet
  - Control/Non-Control => Cognitive dissonance
    - Sex, for example, causes a lot of dissonance related to pleasure and control
  - Wisdom is recognition of good (see my GPT convo debugging the circularity) 

SC2
  - Probably can publish about SC2/LLMs/Learning, etc.
    - Make LLMs do SC2 coaching?
  - Training videos => aids Memory and rehearsal
    - Resumable replays => Branching game states (social collaboration)
    - Transformation and "disruption" -> Ethics of suddent change?
  - Sell book to/through SC2 communities like PiG's?
  - (And Chess): Ecosystems for competitive "education system evolution."  Each player constructs a system, and is sometimes part of larger ones.
     - Incentive to miseducate, to hide and hoard knowledge and learning innovations, to instill toxic mindsets in others
     - Untrusted agents in the system with you...
     - Intelligence signaling / virtue signalling (and mis-signalling, and dog whistling, etc...)


Edu
  - Standardizations / Standardized tests
    * Tyranny of standards:
      - Better than nothing (Hobbs)
    * Rec: Knock it out of the park, and treat the test like a necessary nuisance
  - Inequality and eyesight -> wear glasses.  Inequality and math -> "I'm not a math person."  Hmmm...
  - Learn like you'll live forever. 
    * The human spirit will...  And learning is eternal
  - Min/Max concepts
    * Defend and flesh out the abstract/universal idea here.  Min(X?)|Max(Y?)  What are X and Y?  
      - Concepts?  Abilities?  Fluencies?  Stories?  Things?  Outcomes?  Measurables?
      - Related ideas:
        * James's pragmatism: Essay 1.  Min cause, max effect (mostly re: science)
        * Leibniz: min principles / max variety
        * Optimizations: shortest time, least resistance, most efficiency.
          - Light: Fermat's principle of least action
        * Info theory: Max entropy
        * Game theory: minimax theorem
    * Can we devise K-12++ games that involve "curriculum design" by bartering/bargaining/trading/designing/arranging the min/max concepts.  Discussing the cost and value, etc.
    * Min/max itself is a concept, btw...  value/cost = X.   Compare X_i with X_j to decide on which to do memory work.
    * With AI can we optimize/reduce existing curricula by identifying clever min/max concepts.
    * Hypothesis: Many of the best min/max concepts have yet to be invented.  Many of the best will be cross-disciplinary and will have unifying value across disciplines.
    * Belief: Anything taught in schools should have comprehensible value (prerequisite for informed concent)
      - Ethics of behaviorism
  - More "meta", self-reflective, "critical thinking"
    - Learning should be learning about learning systems
  - "Be the change" -> Self-correcting system.  "To err is human, to self-correct, divine"
    * Institutions, individuals, systems, economies can all be self-correcting.

  - Knowledge:
    - Ready to hand / Present at hand (Fluency level?  Deep vs shallow?)
  - Uh, oh:  AI+any-loving-adult > any-trained-k-12-teacher without AI

  - Language makes problems:
    * If I teach a 3rd grader about how to examine their own breath, others will say: "You are teaching mindfulness"
      - If I teach a "greedy algorithm" I'm teaching "Computer science." 
      - But that's not true.  I'm just teaching a concept that originated in that domain.  
      - People routinely conflate ideas with their domain (cognitive tribalism) -- sometimes accidentally, sometimes maliciously or politically
  - StarTrek: Barclay's BCI


  - Min/Max candidates (TODO: Table with cost and value of each (value to whom? student? society?).  Sort them.  What's the top one?):
    * Fiction/Non-Fiction (useful fictions / metaphor / mnemonics / etc.)
      - Fiction as a skill.  Fiction as knowledge.
      - Examples?
        * Panopticon.edu: Surveyance school, students learn from themselves...  Nothing is forgotten  
      - 3rd kind: "Performative" (Fiction->Non-Fiction.  Causal fiction.  E.g. the Constitution, class charter, etc...)
    * "Failure" as necessary to record
      - Remembering what you forgot (in a session where remembering was the goal)
      - Unpleasantness of failure...
    * 1 thing can have many names.  And that's good...
    * Natural selection
    * Memory mechanics (sometimes less is NOT more)
      - Need a source of weirdness and randomness
    * Systems / Super-organisms / organizations
      - Extended mind / distributed cognition ("cognition" def)
      - Systems evolution/design.  Technical debt
    * Education itself
      - A "moddable" education system (coding in/as/for game)
      - Pre-post test
      - Learning is/can-be uncomfortable 
        - (Learning must be uncomfortable at times?  Do we need SOME tough people in the world?  Grit?)
    * Metaphorical thinking
      - Isomorphism
      - Diffs/comparisons
    * Entropy
    * Mindset 
      - Fixed vs growth
      - Grit
    * Probability
    * Gradient descent 
    * Heuristics
      - Cognitive biases/distortions
    * Set theory.  Venn diagrams.  Category analysis
    * Reps => memory
    * Attention and meta attention

    * Non-linear learning.  Outside-in vs inside-out.  Bottom-up vs Top-down.

    * Domain Expertise !=> Teaching Expertise
      - "Beginner mind" is incomprehensible.  (You are alone...) 
      - Our classrooms are all we've seen

    * Optimization 
      - Being "lazy" is okay.  Time and energy saving is unavoidable.  (Panda as a spirit animal) 
      - Overoptimization?
        * Slow is bad (yes, but how bad?  Pointing out slowness slows things down...)

    * Other Resonant Ideas?

    * Critical thinking about critical thinking.
      - Purpose?  Self-correction.
