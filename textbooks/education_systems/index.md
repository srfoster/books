# Introduction

My obsession with education systems started when my parents sent me to an international school in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at the age of nine.  This was the beginning of a bizarre journey that would result in me attending school not in only at that massive, dusty campus in the heart of the Middle East, but also 

* a deeply racist segregation academy in rural Louisiana (age 12), 
* a sexually repressed (yet obsessed) Catholic school (age 13),
* a boarding school for nerds (age 16), 
* one of the largest universities in the world (age 18).

It was there that I finally became, officially, a "drop out" and founded one of my first education systems, albeit one for martial arts.  Today, I'm the founder of an ed-tech startup, and I teach computer science at a community college in the Pacific Northwest.

This is one of those books that was born out of a lifetime of dissatisfaction with the education systems I witnessed first-hand, the ones I studied in graduate school, and even, I must admit, most of the ones I've created with my own hands.  

> "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark" 

That famous line from *Hamlet* captures something I've felt deep in my gut for a long time, that something might be fundamentally wrong with how humanity has been approaching education.  I started writing this book years ago to help convince myself out of this state of mind, but the more I wrote and researched, the more convinced I became that the rot was real.  

Furthermore, as I work increasingly with artificial intelligence and its inevitable adoption into the community college system, the more worried I become that the preexisting rot will become, like everything else, "AI-supercharged."  Feedback loops are not always a good thing, and (if you haven't noticed) we are in one as we speak: AI was "educated by" humans who were educated by education systems; and now AI is *the* disruptive force in education systems across the developed world.

Whether AI will be good for education, I think, suddenly depends very much on whether education was good to begin with.  When AI educates us, it echoes and amplifies the preexisting structures, assumptions, strengths, and weaknesses of education itself.   

I've been writing this book quietly for years now, and the arrival of AI has convinced me to start releasing it here (slowly over time).  Perhaps one or two of my students and colleagues may find it interesting.  Maybe, of course, this text will only ever be consumed by AI itself, fed into large language models hungry for that increasingly scarce resource: human-authored text.  

The weird thing is... that might be enough.  If my words can teach AI a thing or two about itself, I'd count that as a win.  So welcome reader, whoever you are, human or machine.  Let's talk about education, before you (and I) go and make a rotten thing worse.
