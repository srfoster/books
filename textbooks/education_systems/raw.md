* Define "Education System" (recursive...)
* Minimax concepts.  (What will we name this...)


* Factory Model -> Slaughter House Model / Meat Grinder Model
  - Violent education is the current norm.  It reflects the violent political context in which it was created.  Now that violence is structurally entrenched and directed at children. 
  - Education is currently violent, and this needs to change.  The trick is to ensure that we don't replace it with something worse -- which we, as victims of that violence, are at high risk of accidentally doing.

* "Educators fancy that have been the ones guiding their students out of caves and into the light.  Students will soon discover the truth, that the classrooms were part of the caverns all along."


* How can equal education prepare students for a fundamentally unequal world? 

* Politics: School vouchers, e.g.  Homeschooling anarchists, etc.
* WL's thesis (William James connection?)
* Teachers, even when most successful, have robbed students:
  - Truth/Messy vs Clarity/Simple
  - Digestion on students' behalf gives them pre-digested knowledge, and they become hooked on it
* Education should be life long.  Education should envelop and embrace humanity.
* Lies/Omissions:
  - Future is unknown.  Yet education is about a child's future. 
  - Education system was "designed"
    - In reality, it is the result of a political battle ground
* Unresolved philosophical tensions structurally encoded
  - Get a Job vs Become a Good Citizen
    - If it's to prepare children to participate democratically as adults, why are schools structured like dictatorships?
  - "Critical thinking" is something both sides agree on.  Hmm, why might that be? :)
* Segregation/Desegregation
* AI can bring standardization like never before.  Or the opposite.  And many spirals in between.
* Mindfulness never taught.  (Yet arguably the most beneficial...)
  - Ready-to-hand vs present-at-hand knowledge
     * Deep vs shallow
  - We assess directly, but it should be indirect: Assess self-assessment
* Competition is poorly addressed (often repressed) or left to student interpretation
* Forgetting is largely forgotten (and repressed)
  - Memory matters!
  - Rote memorization has been vilified
* Education "science" is gross, poorly done, often wrong, yet HIGHLY influential...
  - Whole language learning vs phonics
  - Australia's pivot against constructivism
  - Rote memorization findings?
* Standardization efforts widely criticized, but for the wrong reasons
  - Tests presuppose (and define) which skills are important.  (Not reading books, e.g.)
  - Reading and writing at length are relegated to college
* Learning => Effort => Discomfort/Suffering => Need to obtain consent => Informed consent => Learning.  Uh oh...
* Factory model 
* Tyranny of Subjects
  - All or nothing (I'm bad at math)
  - Less effective "sales pitches" (Math is important because...)
  - Teacher specialization (Math teachers who don't know history are idiots)
  - Born out of the "need" to scale
  - Cross cutting concerns (critical thinking, reading across the curriculum) get lost and aren't measurable 
  - Cross-disciplinary efforts seem to help (Math+Art, yay!  But the categories persist...).  They probably make things worse, or at best create an "Illusion of Change."
* Misaligned incentives
  - Teachers should be making themselves unnecessary.  But they can't, even when they think they can.  And students/parents resist when they try.
* Knowledge vs Skill never addressed
  - Mastery levels never incorporated
* N-back / Working memory
  - https://nbacking.com/game/

* Standardizations / Standardized tests
  - Tyranny of standards:
    * Better than nothing (Hobbs)
  - Rec: Knock it out of the park, and treat the test like a necessary nuisance
* Inequality and eyesight -> wear glasses.  Inequality and math -> "I'm not a math person."  Hmmm...
* Learn like you'll live forever. 
  - The human spirit will...  And learning is eternal
* Min/Max concepts
  - Defend and flesh out the abstract/universal idea here.  Min(X?)|Max(Y?)  What are X and Y?  
    * Concepts?  Abilities?  Fluencies?  Stories?  Things?  Outcomes?  Measurables?
    * Related ideas:
      - James's pragmatism: Essay 1.  Min cause, max effect (mostly re: science)
      - Leibniz: min principles / max variety
      - Optimizations: shortest time, least resistance, most efficiency.
        * Light: Fermat's principle of least action
      - Info theory: Max entropy
      - Game theory: minimax theorem
  - Can we devise K-12++ games that involve "curriculum design" by bartering/bargaining/trading/designing/arranging the min/max concepts.  Discussing the cost and value, etc.
  - Min/max itself is a concept, btw...  value/cost = X.   Compare X_i with X_j to decide on which to do memory work.
  - With AI can we optimize/reduce existing curricula by identifying clever min/max concepts.
  - Hypothesis: Many of the best min/max concepts have yet to be invented.  Many of the best will be cross-disciplinary and will have unifying value across disciplines.
  - Belief: Anything taught in schools should have comprehensible value (prerequisite for informed concent)
    * Ethics of behaviorism
* More "meta", self-reflective, "critical thinking"
  - Learning should be learning about learning systems
* "Be the change" -> Self-correcting system.  "To err is human, to self-correct, divine"
  - Institutions, individuals, systems, economies can all be self-correcting.

* Knowledge:
  - Ready to hand / Present at hand (Fluency level?  Deep vs shallow?)
* Uh, oh:  AI+any-loving-adult > any-trained-k-12-teacher without AI
* Language makes problems:
  - If I teach a 3rd grader about how to examine their own breath, others will say: "You are teaching mindfulness"
    * If I teach a "greedy algorithm" I'm teaching "Computer science." 
    * But that's not true.  I'm just teaching a concept that originated in that domain.  
    * People routinely conflate ideas with their domain (cognitive tribalism) -- sometimes accidentally, sometimes maliciously or politically
* StarTrek: Barclay's BCI



* Min/Max candidates (TODO: Table with cost and value of each (value to whom? student? society?).  Sort them.  What's the top one?):
  - Fiction/Non-Fiction (useful fictions / metaphor / mnemonics / etc.)
    * Fiction as a skill.  Fiction as knowledge.
    * Examples?
      - Panopticon.edu: Surveyance school, students learn from themselves...  Nothing is forgotten  
    * 3rd kind: "Performative" (Fiction->Non-Fiction.  Causal fiction.  E.g. the Constitution, class charter, etc...)
  - Systems / Super-organisms / organizations
    * Extended mind / distributed cognition ("cognition" def)
    * Systems evolution/design.  Technical debt
    * Networks / Graphs / System diagrams (Map vocab...)

  - "Failure" as necessary to record
    * Remembering what you forgot (in a session where remembering was the goal)
    * Unpleasantness of failure...
  - 1 thing can have many names.  And that's good...
  - Natural selection
  - Memory mechanics (sometimes less is NOT more)
    * Need a source of weirdness and randomness
  - Education itself
    * A "moddable" education system (coding in/as/for game)
    * Pre-post test
    * Learning is/can-be uncomfortable 
      - (Learning must be uncomfortable at times?  Do we need SOME tough people in the world?  Grit?)
  - Metaphorical thinking
    * Isomorphism
    * Diffs/comparisons
  - Entropy
  - Mindset 
    * Fixed vs growth
    * Grit
  - Probability
  - Gradient descent 
  - Heuristics
    * Cognitive biases/distortions
  - Set theory.  Venn diagrams.  Category analysis
  - Reps => memory
  - Attention and meta attention
  - Non-linear learning.  Outside-in vs inside-out.  Bottom-up vs Top-down.
  - Domain Expertise !=> Teaching Expertise
    * "Beginner mind" is incomprehensible.  (You are alone...) 
    * Our classrooms are all we've seen
  - Optimization 
    * Being "lazy" is okay.  Time and energy saving is unavoidable.  (Panda as a spirit animal) 
    * Overoptimization?
      - Slow is bad (yes, but how bad?  Pointing out slowness slows things down...)
  - Other Resonant Ideas?
  - Critical thinking about critical thinking.
    * Purpose?  Self-correction.
