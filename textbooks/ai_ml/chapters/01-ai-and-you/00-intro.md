# Is AI Yours or Theirs?

In this chapter, I hope to help you achieve a shift in how you relate to AI -- a shift that myself and many of my colleagues have been making since ChatGPT was released in 2022.  In short: I want to empower you to call generative AI "*yours*".

"But wait," my students often say. "Don't companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI own their generative AI models?  We can't just download those, right?"

To which I would answer: Yes, they do; and no you can't.

However, there are many powerful open source AI models that anyone with a bit of grit and know-how can acquire, use, and modify.[^1] By the end of this chapter, I'd like you to be able to say that you've acquired some of this "AI stuff" for yourself and made it your own.  This will set us up nicely to begin asking the key questions of our time, "Just what *is* this 'AI stuff'?  And what can I do with it?"

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter, I hope that you'll know:

- How to download free generative AI models from the internet and "install them."
- How to "ask" these models to generate text and/or images for you.
- How to write programs that make these models do things they previously couldn't.

And yes, I'm aware that we haven't even defined terms like "generative AI" and "AI model" yet.  We'll do a bit more of that in Chapter 2.  For now, please think of yourself as someone first learning to drive a car.  We'll define "internal combustion" after you've experienced the engine's vibrations, revved the gas, rolled down the window, and felt the wind on your face.

[^1]: Perhaps one day, the general public will have access to the flagship proprietary models too (ChatGPT, Claude, and Grok).  Considering that 1) these models were trained in large part on public data (yours and that of your friends and family), and 2) the myriad innovations that made the training possible was funded over many decades by public tax dollars (yours and that of your family and friends), I think there's a compelling ethical argument that these world-shaping technologies should also be made public.  But I don't make the rules.
