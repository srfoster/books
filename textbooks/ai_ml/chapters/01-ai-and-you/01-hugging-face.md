# Hugging Face

We're going to go through a series of exercises designed to place a pre-existing AI model within your sphere of control.  Then, throughout this book, we'll repeat that process for more and more interesting models, including ones you design and train yourself.

By the end of this first chapter, the goal is to have an environment in which you can work with AI.  Note that you may find yourself facing certain logistical challenges (e.g. lack of hard drive space, lack of computing power, lack of a GPU, etc.), and one byproduct of these exercises is to put you face-to-face with these common stumbling blocks as soon as possible.

Overcoming these challenges early is a good thing.  In the exercises that follow, I'll try to suggest workarounds to common problems.
