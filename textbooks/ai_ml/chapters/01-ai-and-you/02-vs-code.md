## üõ†Ô∏èTry This - VS Code and Copilot

**Time estimate.** 30 minutes.

**Overview.** This exercise is designed to help you set up an environment in which you can write code and work with AI models. We'll install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and GitHub Copilot, giving you both a powerful code editor and an AI coding assistant.

**Justification.** Even if you have never coded before, you'll need a development environment to work with AI models locally. VS Code is free, widely used, and has excellent support for Python and AI development. GitHub Copilot will act as your coding mentor, helping you write code even if you're a beginner. This combination gives you both the tools and the AI assistance to start building.

**Steps.**
1. Download and install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the Python extension (search "Python" in the Extensions marketplace)
3. Install Python from https://python.org (if not already installed)
4. Sign up for GitHub Copilot (free for students, or try the free trial)
5. Install the GitHub Copilot extension in VS Code
6. Create a new file called `hello_ai.py`
7. Write a simple "Hello, World" program in Python
8. Try asking Copilot to help you write a function that generates a random motivational quote
9. Run your program using VS Code's integrated terminal

**Deliverable.** A working Python "Hello, World" program that runs successfully in VS Code, plus a screenshot showing Copilot suggesting code for you.

**Discussion.** How did it feel to have an AI assistant helping you code? Even if you're an experienced programmer, notice how Copilot changes your workflow. This is a preview of how AI will augment human capabilities throughout this book - not replacing human creativity, but amplifying it.
