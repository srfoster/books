# What to Expect

Welcome to the world of "intelligent" machines.  My goal is to help you understand not just how AI works, but how to work with it effectively and how to make AI models do things that they could not previously do.

I'll only say a few words about my educational philosophy here (for more, I would recommend [Why School Sucks](/#/textbook/education_systems), my book about education systems).  However, I'll briefly mention that I believe:

* **Time is a scarce resource.**  For every learning goal in this book, I'll try to clearly convey why I believe it's worth your time.  If you ever happen to disagree, I invite you in advance to skip or skim that content.
* **Enjoyment matters.**  To the best of my ability, I've tried to sequence each chapter such that they are approachable and interesting, weaving in relevant stories and anecdotes as appropriate.
* **Memory matters.**  Each chapter concludes with a self-assessment to help you measure whether you've understood the key ideas well enough to make use of them later.
* **We learn by doing.**  The book is full of practical exercises marked with üõ†Ô∏è"Try this".   In my humble opinion, actually *doing* the exercises is just as important as reading the text. 

With all of this said, we're ready to dive into one of the most influential bodies of knowledge in human history.  It's no exaggeration to say that AI is changing the world, quite literally, as you read this.  In the time that passes while you read this sentence, generative AI models across the globe have collectively generated more words than most humans read in a lifetime.[^1]

Personally, I believe it's possible to bring about a world in which the average human understands AI better than it understands us.  Time is scarce, though, especially for biological beings such as ourselves, constantly assailed by the inconveniences of sleep, hunger, and the countless other forces that compete for our attention.

We'd better get started.

[^1]: Based on the scale of deployment reported by major AI companies. For example, OpenAI reported over 100 million weekly active users for ChatGPT as of early 2023, with usage continuing to grow across multiple AI platforms.  In 2024, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman [announced](https://x.com/sama/status/1756089361609981993?lang=en) that OpenAI was generating about 100 billion words per day.  That's more than a million words per second.
