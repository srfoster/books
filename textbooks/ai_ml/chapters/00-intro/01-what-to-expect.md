# What to Expect

Welcome to the world of Artificial Intelligence. I'm hoping to help you understand not just how AI works, but how to work with it effectively.  I won't write too much about my educational philosophy here (for that, I would recommend [Why School Sucks](/#/textbook/education_systems), my book about education systems).  However, I'll briefly mention that I believe:

* **Time is a scarse resource.**  If I teach you something, I'll try to clearly convey why I believe it's worth your time.  If you ever happen to disagree, I invite you in advance to skip or skim that content.
* **Enjoyment matters.**  To the best of my ability, I've tried to sequence each chapter such that they are approachable and interesting. 
* **Memory matters.**  Each chapter concludes with a self-assessment to help you measure whether you've understood the key ideas.
* **We learn by doing.**  The book is full of practical exercises marked with üõ†Ô∏è"Try this".   In my humble opinion, doing these is just as important as reading the text. 

With all of this said, we're ready to dive into one of the most influential bodies of knowledge in human history.  It's no exageration to say that AI is changing the world, quite literally, "as we speak."

Personally, I long to live in a world where the average human being understands AI better than it understands us.  Time is a scare resource, though, especially for us humans.  So we'd better get started.
