# Chapter 3: Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Coming Soon! ðŸ¤–

This chapter introduces the core concepts and algorithms that power modern machine learning.

### What You'll Learn:
- Supervised vs. unsupervised vs. reinforcement learning
- Linear regression and classification
- Decision trees and ensemble methods
- Neural networks basics
- Training, validation, and testing
- Overfitting, underfitting, and model selection
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

### Why This Matters:
Understanding these fundamentals will give you the conceptual framework to approach any machine learning problem with confidence. You'll learn not just how to use algorithms, but when and why to use them.
