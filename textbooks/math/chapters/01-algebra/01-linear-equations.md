# Linear Equations

A linear equation is an equation that makes a straight line when graphed on a coordinate plane. These equations form the foundation of algebra and appear in countless real-world applications.

## Standard Form

The standard form of a linear equation in one variable is:

$$ax + b = c$$

Where:
- $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants
- $x$ is the variable we're solving for
- $a \neq 0$ (otherwise it wouldn't be linear)

## Solving Linear Equations

The goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. We use these fundamental operations:

1. **Addition/Subtraction**: Add or subtract the same value from both sides
2. **Multiplication/Division**: Multiply or divide both sides by the same non-zero value

### Example 1: Basic Linear Equation

Solve: $3x + 7 = 22$

**Step 1**: Subtract 7 from both sides
$$3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7$$
$$3x = 15$$

**Step 2**: Divide both sides by 3
$$\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}$$
$$x = 5$$

**Check**: $3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22$ âœ“

### Example 2: Equation with Fractions

Solve: $\frac{2x}{3} - 4 = 8$

**Step 1**: Add 4 to both sides
$$\frac{2x}{3} = 12$$

**Step 2**: Multiply both sides by $\frac{3}{2}$
$$x = 12 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 18$$

## Linear Equations in Two Variables

The general form is: $ax + by = c$

These equations represent lines in the coordinate plane.

### Slope-Intercept Form

$$y = mx + b$$

Where:
- $m$ is the slope (rise over run)
- $b$ is the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis)

### Example: Graphing a Line

Graph: $y = 2x - 3$

- **Slope**: $m = 2$ (up 2, right 1)
- **Y-intercept**: $b = -3$ (point $(0, -3)$)

## Applications

### Distance and Rate Problems

If a car travels at 60 mph for $t$ hours, the distance is:
$$d = 60t$$

### Cost Analysis

If a phone plan costs $30 plus $0.10 per minute:
$$C = 30 + 0.10m$$

Where $C$ is total cost and $m$ is minutes used.

## Practice Problems

1. Solve: $5x - 12 = 23$
2. Solve: $\frac{x}{4} + 7 = 11$
3. Find the slope and y-intercept of: $3x + 2y = 12$
4. A taxi charges $3.50 plus $2.25 per mile. Write an equation for the total cost.
