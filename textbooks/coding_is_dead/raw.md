* CIS110 -> Make memory/rehearsal front and center
  - Recursion
  - Vlogging journey?  Old outcomes are alt path? (But let them choose?)
* Min/Max concepts: Come up with a concrete list of them for CS (ideally ones that span disciplines)
  - Pre/post test
  - Metaphorical thinking
  - Greedy algorithms
  - Bottom up / Top down
  - Breadth first / Depth first
  - Pseudo-code (for humans / humanities)
  - Various "data structures of the mind" 
  - Technical debt (AI coding especially)

* Candidate MinMax Concepts:
  - ...


* Long live psuedo code
  - Can be compiled now
  - The universal human value of algorithms
    - Fiction/non-fiction/"performative"(coding)


* You are an information system
  - You used to be you, then you+internet, now you+internet+ai
    - Hidden in the + are a bunch of knowledge and skills that most people don't have.
    - In theory, AI can help with the + parts...
* Understanding and productivity are inversely proportional
* Good coding practice "resists memory" 
  - Every function created
  - Every library 
  - Now, AI gives us even more degrees of freedom 

* More degrees of freedom => Higher entropy (more ways to go wrong)
