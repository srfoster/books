Virtue is the only good, and is wisdom a circle?

* Gratitude.  Joy.

* Over what, if anything, do we have control always, already, and at all times?

* Mindfulness "skills": What are they?
  - Observation of breath?

* "Pulling your mind back together" - Hanh

* Seeking suffering

  - Boredom
  - Not thinking (finding internal stimulation)

* Suffering == "Not to be"

On cold plunges and the idea of voluntarily seeking discomfort.

I came across this video where this guy (author of Sapiens) gave a pretty compelling argument that the definition of "consciousness" is the "capacity to suffer" and that "suffering" is best defined as "wanting something not to be."  (No need to watch the whole thing, just the a few minutes starting here if you want:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r5lw3jPrUk&t=1030s)

My conclusion after watching was that if one wants to voluntarily experience discomfort (e.g. suffering) and to acclimate to it, then the trick is to seek out experiences in which there is a desire for something "not to be."  Very cold water, for example, immediately makes me wish all the pain would "not be" -- ideally, as quickly as possible.  Exercise makes me wish all my sweat and burning muscles would "not be," and meditation often makes me wish my boredom would "not be."   Generalizing: Any situation that irritates, annoys, evokes a negative emotional response, or triggers a desire to change things probably contains one or more things that the mind wishes would "not be."  Any such situation (assuming it doesn't result in injury) would, I think, be a good context for leveling up through voluntary suffering

An introduction to Stoic philosophy and its practical applications in contemporary living.

## What is Stoicism?

Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophy founded in Athens around 300 BCE by Zeno of Citium. Rather than being about suppressing emotions (a common misconception), Stoicism teaches us how to think clearly, act with purpose, and maintain inner peace regardless of external circumstances.

## Core Principles

### **The Dichotomy of Control**
> "Some things are within our control, while others are not."
> — Epictetus

The fundamental Stoic teaching distinguishes between:
- **What we can control**: Our thoughts, actions, and responses
- **What we cannot control**: External events, other people's actions, the past and future

### **Virtue as the Highest Good**
The Stoics identified four cardinal virtues:
1. **Wisdom** (Sophia) - Understanding what is true and beneficial
2. **Justice** (Dikaiosyne) - Treating others fairly and acting morally
3. **Fortitude** (Andreia) - Courage in facing challenges
4. **Temperance** (Sophrosyne) - Self-discipline and moderation

### **Living According to Nature**
For Stoics, "living according to nature" means:
- Using reason to guide our actions
- Accepting what we cannot change
- Working for the common good
- Maintaining emotional equilibrium

## Key Stoic Figures

### **Epictetus (55-135 CE)**
A former slave who became one of the most influential Stoic teachers. His teachings emphasize personal freedom through self-discipline.

### **Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE)**
Roman Emperor and philosopher, author of "Meditations" - personal reflections on Stoic principles.

### **Seneca (4 BCE - 65 CE)**
Roman statesman and advisor, known for practical letters on Stoic ethics and daily life.

## Modern Applications

Stoicism remains remarkably relevant today, offering tools for:
- Managing stress and anxiety
- Making better decisions
- Building resilience
- Improving relationships
- Finding meaning and purpose

## Daily Practices

### **Morning Reflection**
Begin each day by considering what challenges you might face and how you can respond virtuously.

### **Evening Review**
End each day by reflecting on your actions and thoughts, identifying areas for improvement.

### **Negative Visualization**
Periodically imagine losing things you value to increase gratitude and reduce attachment.
