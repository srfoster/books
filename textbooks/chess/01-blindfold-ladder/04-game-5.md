# Blind in the Colosseum

## 5.

Before this game, I resolved to have a warm up process before games:

* Ensure that previous games have been processed.  If not, catch up. 
* Reread previous games.
* Eyes closed: Board vision exercises (TODO: Write these down)

**1. e4 c6 2. d3 d5 3. Nd2 dxe4 4. dxe4 Qc7** I haven't seen this variation before.  I assume it's sub-optimal, but maybe that's unfair...

**5. Ngf3 Bg4** I considered playing for *h3/g4** instead of **g3**, but I decided to go for the usual setup.  It seems to invite players to try to pile up on f3, which doesn't ever seem to work for them, so I guess that's good.

* First blindfold win against a Caro
* Wow, what a game: A win against a +2000!  Took a time pressure peek at move 27 (3 minutes left, but a relatively straightforward conversion).
* Was still pretty nervous: Had to continually refocus on my breath
* Dropped e4 again!  But this time, the tactics seemed to be in my favor, and I'm not so sure it counts as the same kind of blunder as Game 4.  In this one, I think my intuition about their king positioning (still in the center) led my brain to start "gambiting."  Still, I'd like to avoid mistakes even if they are also kinda gambits...
* But I admit, I didn't calculate as well as I should have.  Didn't even see 16. ... Nd7 as a defense.  In a way, I guess I'm glad I didn't because it was a fun sacrificial combination starting with a queen trade.  I don't know if it was sound, but I definitely ended up with a lot of pressure on
