# Blind in the Colosseum

## 3.

This game was quite the rollercoaster, but I'm proud of it because 1) I won (superficial, I know, but hey: I'm human), 2) I went much longer before taking a "time pressure peek", and 3) I was able to immediately make use of my last game's insight: to consider other options when finding myself in an unexpected suboptimal situation.

I also did a good job of managing my nerves.  This has been steadily improving since Game 1, and I hope it continues.  Deep breaths...

**1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 g6 4. Bg5 Bg7 5. e5 Nfd7 6. e6 fxe6** This is the "consolation prize" of the Byrne Trap.  But as we see in the game, black's congestion is also a future central pawn mass and an extra pawn.  Foreshadowing: This becomes instrumental in me having major winning chances even after losing the exchange. 

**7. Nf3 Nb6 8. Qd2 O-O 9. Bh6 Nc6 10. Bxg7 Kxg7 11. O-O-O Nd5 12. Nxd5 exd5** I find it fascinating how that f-pawn has been "promoted" to a d-pawn via captures along the g8-a2 diagonal.  There's something very geometrically/mnemonically striking about this.

**13. h4 Bg4 14. Be2 Qd7 15. Rhe1 Rae8 16. Ng5**  Not on my radar was the threat of **Ne6+** because I was under the mistaken impression that my king was on g8 (where it would normally be).  This is as good a time as any to quote myself from my thoughts immediately after the game:

> I forgot my insight from a few games ago, but I'd like to remember it in the future: *To continually review the notation-so-far, rather than relying fully on my memory of where the pieces are. At minimum, I think this habit will increase my retention of the game after the fact. I suspect it will also reduce the number of pieces that "go missing" or "migrate."*

**16. ... Bf5 17. g4** The only consolation is that I get yet another pawn after it's all said and done.  At the time, I must admit, I thought I was just winning a pawn and that my opponent had blundered it with a counting error.  

**17. ... Bxg4 18. Bxg4 Qxg4 19. Ne6+ Kg8 20. Nxf8 Kxf8 21. Qh6+ Kg8 22. Rg1 Qf5** I considered other candidates.  But I felt this was the most solid and simple, and fresh on my mind was my misguided attempt to complexify things in Game 3.  So I'm pretty proud of how I handled things calmly even though I felt I was losing.  (Objectively, I think I might not be, but I haven't yet checked the engine.)

**23. Kb1 e5 24. h5 Re6 25. Rg5? Qf8 26. Qxf8+ Kxf8** Pretty sure that trading queens was not something my opponent wanted.  It take a lot of the fun out of their attack, and suddenly they have to reckon with a very uncertain endgame.  The board's "center of mass" shifts away from my king, which is a sigh of relief. 

**27. hxg6 Rxg6 28. Rxg6 hxg6 29. c3 e4 30. Rg1 Kg7 31. Kc1 Kf6 32. Kd2 Ne7 33. Rf1 Nf5 34. f4 c5 35. dxc5 dxc5 36. b4 cxb4 37. cxb4 d4 38. Rc1** This is the position where I took off the blindfold (~1 min left on my clock). Time pressure aside, I was pleased to see that I had two queenside pawns left. In my brain, I had only an a-pawn. Not sure why except that maybe I subconsciously "took the opponent at their word" that their move 36. b4 was a reasonable plan. It would be, if it were forcing a 2-on-1 majority.

**38. .. Nd6 39. Rc7 Kf5 40. Rd7 Nc4+ 41. Ke2 d3+ 42. Ke1 Kxf4 43. Rxb7 Ke3 44. Rxa7 d2+ 45. Kd1 Nb2+ 46. Kc2 d1=Q+ 47. Kxb2 Qd4+ 0-1**  Not sure if that final sequence was unstoppable, but I personally find it unforgettable: The noble knight and final piece giving its life to ensure that the d-pawn (which is the original f-pawn!) saves the day.

Some final notes:

* I decided mid-game to not worry about the "writing my move before playing it" habit. I keep forgetting anyway, and I'm not really seeing any value from doing so. In fact, it's just extra cognitive load at this point.
* I felt that my selection of 22... Qf5 (what I saw as the safe, simple option) was directly motivated by my previous insight that "make wild complications right away" is not the only strategy. Here, I opted for what I felt was a simpler, more "grindy" strategy, which seems to have paid off.
* I'm going to resist the temptation to look with the engine and first try to analyze the game myself, blindfolded :)
* My exercises of analyzing all moves (and psuedo-moves / lines of force) from the starting position earlier today was really helpful. I had a moment or two today during the game where I felt I was able to very quickly "mind touch" all of the candidate moves. My goal is to be able to do so during any position. But inevitably, I find myself not having quite enough time to maintain a full inventory of the position's possibilities while blindfolded, but just as a "pump" at the gym gives one a glimpse into the future of one's weight-lifting journey, I feel like I am glimpsing what it will be like one day after enough dedicated blindfold practice.
