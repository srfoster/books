## 1. 

### stephenfoster (1860?) - VIVANGREAT125 (1823)

Vivan takes an aggressive (but, in my view, dubious) setup with the Knight lunging forward on g4: **1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d3[^1] Nf6 4. g3 Bc5 5. Bg2 Ng4?!**  In the game, the word "disrespectful" immediately crossed my mind.  As in: Surely, Black cannot get away with moving the Knight twice so soon unless he thinks I'm going to crumble under this flimsy attack; if he respected my ability to defend, he would not be so reckless.

* **But is it so reckless?** White's advantage after this "mistake" is minuscule: less than half a pawn.  

* **Is it wise of me to view it as "reckless" or "disrespectful"?**  I'm on the fence about moralistic "mind-reading" judgments like these.  One might argue such judgments have some mnemonic/storytelling value: e.g. "Stephen the Blind" vanquishes "Vivan the Reckless", punishing him for his disrespectful playing style.  But that's only the case after the fact.  During a game, by contrast, when the battle is still in question, such ego-driven desires to win are often key contributors to my poor decisions.  

**6. O-O h5**

Hardly a surprise.  I haven't asked the oracle (the engine) whether this move is good yet.  But I recall that during the game, I more or less expected this as a follow up to Ng4.  It did give me a key decision to make: play h3 now and see if Black is willing to sac the Knight to open the h-file.  I ultimately decided against this, figuring that it was what Black would expect:

* **Is it good to be unexpected?** I feel it may have some psychological value, but I have no hard evidence for this.  I just know that unexpected moves do, at times, evoke in me an emotional response.  Plus, an unexpected is more likely to force additional calculation from the opponent.  My current theory on the matter is that calculation means: more fatigue, more entropy, more chance of error. 

* **Is it good to avoid complications?** During blindfold games, I find myself worrying (probably for good reason) that I might get lost in the sea of complexities and run down my clock.  Still, it's an open question when to sail directly into the storm and when to avoid it.

I chose, at this point, to wait and develop.

**7. Nc3 d6?!**

Interestingly, though I have no more insight into Vivan's mind on move 7 than I did on move 5, I "read" this move as an oversight and felt quite smug.  I believed that Vivan had failed to see that **7. Nc3** was potentially threating the Bishop on c5.  Now, with **7. ... d6** how is Vivan the Reckless supposed to save the Bishop, a key attacker?  It should be noted, however, that I don't know this move is truly a mistake, and I don't know whether such judgments are actually helping me or hindering me.

That's an open question that I am hoping to answer with more games.

I go for the Bishop and White initiates some additional trades: 

**8. Na4 Nd4 9. Nxc5 dxc5 10. h3 Nxf3+ 11. Qxf3 Nf6**.  

With the Knight forced to retreat, it certainly feels like Black's **5. ... Ng4** was a mistake.  Again, though: A judgement.  Has Black's Knight been slapped back?   Is it retreating with its tail between its legs?  Or is it simply, calmly regrouping?  It's very easy (at least for me) to jump from moralistic judgments to anthropomorphization of the opponent's pieces.  Are such anthropomorphizations pragmatic?  Does their mnemonic/excitement value justify their possible objective wrongness?  

Again, I hope to answer such philosophical questions with more battles in the gladiatorial arena.

This was the moment when I felt the opponent had made a true mistake: 

**12. Bg5 Qd6 13. Rfd1 Bd7 14. c3 O-O-O?**  

To castle Queenside, *into* the potential energy of my Queen and Bishop battery, just smelled bad.  I already wanted to play d4, and now it carries with it some extra sting (namely, the opportunity to clear my own e pawn out of the way): **15. d4 exd4 16. e5 Bc6 17. exd6 Bxf3**

My next move is actually a blunder: **18. dxc7?**  As the engine points out, Rd5 is a key idea (attacking my Bishop on g5, which was invisible to me!), and I didn't see it at all.  A few ways to look at this:

* An instance of an "undefended piece error" -- which I think it was committed on move **12. Bg5**, where I moved the Bishop to a safe square but should have made note of the fact that it was now undefended.  
* A counting error on this move.  My problem: hanging rook; Black's problem: hanging Bishop (which is the source of my hanging rook).  Simplest: Take the bishop, unhang the rook.  But I thought I could squeeze more: Giving them an additional hanging Rook, which I thought would lead to more trades.  Sadly, Black get's the d-file/d5-square, which is convertable to: unhanging their Rook and giving me a hanging Bishop.  Now I STILL have the hanging Rook, only a newly hanging Bishop on top of it, and the best is to just cash in on their hanging Bishop, giving up mine in the process.  (TODO: Can we simplify this kind of thought process into a more formal "calculus"?  It gets tricky with pieces able to do double duty: move to safety and make a threat; or take a piece that is making a threat, thereby removing the threat.)

I opted for this move thinking that it forced more trades.  My opponent luckily does oblige me in this regard, but I do wish that I had seen this.

**18. ... Bxd1 19. cxd8=Q+ Rxd8 20. Rxd1 dxc3 21. Rxd8+ Kxd8 22. bxc3 b6 23. Bxf6+ gxf6 24. Bf3 a5 25. Bxh5 Ke7**

With the trade-down complete, the rest of the game was a matter of technique.  The only problem was that I was low on time.  On about move 32, I took a peek at the board (with less than 3 minutes left).  I'd prefer to get good enough to avoid this, but I am not yet strong enough. 

**26. Bd1 b5 27. a4 b4 28. cxb4 cxb4 29. Bb3 f5 30. f4 Kf6 31. Kf2 Kg6 32. Kf3 f6 33. g4 fxg4+ 34. hxg4 Kg7 35. Ke4 Kg6 36. Kd5 Kf7 37. Kc5+ Ke7 38. Kb5 Kd6 39. Kxa5 Kc5 40. g5 fxg5 41. fxg5 Kd4 42. g6 Kc3 43. Bf7 b3 44. Bxb3 Kxb3 45. g7 Kb2 46. g8=Q Ka1 47. Qg2 Kb1 48. Kb4 Kc1 49. Kc3 Kd1 50. Qd2# 1-0**

[^1]: Should I be preferring 3. g3 instead of 3.d3?  The chess.com database gives a higher winning percentage for 3. g3, so I think I'll start trying that one more often.  (NOTE: Both have similar a similar engine eval, but I'd like to explore some less charted territories.)
