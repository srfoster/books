* Memory => Time Cost => "Why?" => ? 
* Dates (and numbers) are already a mnemonic system
* SRS is often suggested, and forgetting curve often talked about.  
  - But never with enough nuance.
  - What should a "card" be?  Or a deck?  Or a sequence of cards?  Or a group?  (Storification, e.g.)
  - Why SRS and not a mnemonic device?  Which one?  Pair them?  How?
* SRS vs mnemonics 
* Why not SAFMEDS?
* Mnemonic devices:
  - Drawing/Animation
  - Story
  - Structure
  - Game
* Reference (external); Memory (internal); ????? (external->internal)
  - Traditional teacher role.
