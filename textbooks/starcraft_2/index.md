# StarCraft II

I don't know why it took so long. Almost a lifetime, really, to commit to actually memorizing (and therefore practicing, and rehearsing) builds.

This book resulted from putting my own educational philosophy into action to educate myself.  You'll see certain common themes from throughout my textbooks: the skill/knowledge dichotomy, heavy use of custom educational technology, writing to learn, min cost / max value, etc.
